# &infin; What is Jooby (do more, more easily)

[Jooby](http://jooby.org) a scalable, fast and modular micro web framework for Java, [JavaScript](http://jooby.org/doc/lang-js) and [Kotlin](http://jooby.org/doc/lang-kotlin).

* **Simple, effective and easy to learn**. Ideal for small but also large scale applications.

* **Scalable**. Stateless application development.

* **Fast**. Thanks to the most popular [NIO web servers](http://jooby.org/doc/servers).

* **Modular**. Make it **full-stack** via the extensive [module eco-system](http://jooby.org/modules).

* **Ready for the modern web**, with the awesome and powerful [asset module](https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/tree/master/jooby-assets)

# &infin; What is Rethinkdb (The open-source database for the realtime web)

* **Open-source** database for building realtime web applications
* **NoSQL** database that stores schemaless JSON documents
* **Distributed** database that is easy to scale
* **High availability** database with automatic failover and robust fault tolerance

RethinkDB is the first open-source scalable database built for realtime applications. It exposes a new database access model -- instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell the database to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB allows developers to build scalable realtime apps in a fraction of the time with less effort.

Not sure what types of projects RethinkDB can help you build? Here are a few examples:

* Build a [realtime liveblog](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-pubnub/) with RethinkDB and PubNub
* Create a [collaborative photo sharing whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdPRp3UxL_s)
* Build an [IRC bot in Go](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/go-irc-bot/) with RethinkDB changefeeds
* Look at [cats on Instagram in realtime](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/cats-of-instagram/)
* Watch [how Platzi uses RethinkDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb_UzRYDB40) to educate

# &infin; Jooby rethinkdb Module
* Provide simple integration between Scalable, fast and modular micro web framework and open-source database for the realtime web
